## 💬 CUSTOMER PERCEPTION

### **Before:**
> "They say they can do it in one day? That seems too good to be true. I'm skeptical about the quality."

### **After:**
> "2-3 days is reasonable for a quality job. They're being honest about the timeline. I trust them more."

## ⏱️ TIMELINE CLARITY

### **Before (Confusing):**
```
"We prep, coat, and cure your floor in a single day"
"Walk on it in hours, drive on it in 24"

❓ Does this mean:
- Project is done in 1 day?
- Can drive on it after 24 hours?
- What about curing?
```

### **After (Clear):**
```
"Most projects completed within 2-3 days"
"Walk on the surface in hours"
"Fully cured in 24-48 hours"

✅ Clear timeline:
- Project completion: 2-3 days
- Walking: A few hours
- Full curing: 24-48 hours
```
