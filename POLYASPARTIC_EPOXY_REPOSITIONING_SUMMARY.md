### 5. **DIY Epoxy Comparison** ✅

**Updated FAQ Answer (lines 434-440, 669-674):**

**Before:**
> "There is no comparison. Our system uses industrial-grade polyaspartic materials and professional diamond-grinding preparation. This ensures a bond that will not peel or fail, unlike DIY kits which often use inferior epoxy and rely on acid etching, which is a far less effective preparation method."

**After:**
> "Professional installation makes a significant difference. Our system uses industrial-grade materials and professional diamond-grinding preparation, which ensures a permanent bond that will not peel or fail. DIY kits often rely on acid etching, which is a far less effective preparation method. We offer both epoxy and polyaspartic options—polyaspartic provides superior durability and faster curing, while epoxy offers a cost-effective solution. Either way, professional installation guarantees superior results compared to DIY approaches."
