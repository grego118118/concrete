## Coating Types & Materials

### **Polyaspartic Coating**
A two-component polyurethane coating that cures rapidly (1-4 hours) and provides superior durability. UV-stable, chemical-resistant, and 4x more durable than epoxy. Ideal for garage and basement floors.

**Key Benefits:**
- Fast cure time (1 day installation)
- UV-stable (won't yellow)
- Chemical resistant
- 4x more durable than epoxy
- Available in multiple colors and flake finishes

### **Epoxy Coating**
A two-component resin coating that provides good durability but slower cure times (24-48 hours). Can yellow over time when exposed to UV light. More affordable than polyaspartic but less durable.

**Comparison to Polyaspartic:**
- Slower cure time
- Can yellow in sunlight
- Less durable (2-3 years vs 5-10 years)
- More affordable upfront
- Good for indoor-only applications

### **Vinyl Flakes**
Decorative vinyl particles broadcast onto the base coat to add color, texture, and visual appeal. Available in various colors and patterns (Domino, Tidal Wave, Yosemite, Garnet).

**Flake Options:**
- **Domino (FB-411):** Black to gray gradient
- **Tidal Wave (FB-807):** Blue, gray, beige, and white
- **Yosemite (FB-4215):** Earth tones
- **Garnet (F9305):** Deep burgundy and red

## Installation Process

### **Diamond Grinding**
Mechanical grinding using diamond-tipped tools to remove surface imperfections, stains, and old coatings. Opens the concrete's pores for better adhesion and permanent bonding.

**Why It Matters:**
- Removes contaminants
- Creates surface profile for bonding
- Ensures permanent adhesion
- Prevents peeling or failure

### **Base Coat**
The first layer of polyaspartic coating applied to the prepared concrete. Provides color and serves as the foundation for the decorative flakes.

### **Broadcast**
The process of spreading vinyl flakes onto the wet base coat. Creates the decorative pattern and texture of the finished floor.

### **Scrape & Vacuum**
After the base coat cures, excess flakes are scraped off and vacuumed away to create a smooth, even surface ready for the top coat.

### **Top Coat**
The final clear polyaspartic layer applied over the flakes. Provides UV protection, chemical resistance, and a glossy finish.

**Ideal For:**
- Finished basements
- Home gyms
- Playrooms
- Storage areas
- Workshops

## Technical Terms

### **Adhesion**
The bond between the coating and the concrete substrate. Proper surface preparation (diamond grinding) ensures permanent adhesion and prevents peeling.

### **Cure Time**
The time required for the coating to fully harden. Polyaspartic: 1-4 hours. Epoxy: 24-48 hours.

### **UV Stability**
Resistance to ultraviolet light. Polyaspartic coatings are UV-stable and won't yellow. Epoxy coatings can yellow over time.

### **Chemical Resistance**
The coating's ability to resist damage from oils, grease, solvents, and other chemicals. Polyaspartic provides superior chemical resistance.

### **Non-Porous Surface**
A sealed surface that doesn't absorb liquids or contaminants. Makes cleaning easy and prevents staining.

### **Gloss Level**
The shine or reflectivity of the finished surface. Options typically include:
- **High Gloss:** Shiny, reflective finish
- **Satin:** Moderate shine
- **Matte:** Minimal shine

## Maintenance & Care

### **pH-Neutral Cleaner**
A mild cleaning solution that won't damage the coating. Recommended for regular maintenance.

**Cleaning Steps:**
1. Sweep or vacuum debris
2. Mix pH-neutral cleaner with water
3. Mop or squeegee the floor
4. Rinse with clean water
5. Allow to dry

### **Spill Management**
The non-porous surface allows spills to be wiped up immediately without staining.

**Best Practices:**
- Wipe spills immediately
- Use soft mops or squeegees
- Avoid abrasive scrubbing
- Use pH-neutral cleaners only

## Industry Standards

### **ASTM Standards**
American Society for Testing and Materials standards that define coating quality and performance requirements.

### **VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds)**
Chemical emissions from coatings. Lower VOC products are more environmentally friendly and safer to apply.

### **Durability Rating**
Measured in years of expected performance under normal conditions. Polyaspartic: 5-10 years. Epoxy: 2-3 years.

---

## Comparison Terms

### **Durable**
Long-lasting and resistant to wear, damage, and environmental factors. Polyaspartic is 4x more durable than epoxy.

### **Cost-Effective**
Providing good value for the investment. While polyaspartic costs more upfront, the longer lifespan makes it more cost-effective.

### **Professional Installation**
Installation by trained technicians using proper equipment and techniques. Ensures quality results and warranty coverage.
