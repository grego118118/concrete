## Polyaspartic vs DIY Epoxy Kits

| Factor | Professional Polyaspartic | DIY Epoxy Kit |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------|
| **Durability** | 5-10 years | 1-2 years |
| **Preparation** | Professional diamond grinding | Acid etching (less effective) |
| **Application** | Professional equipment | Roller/brush |
| **Adhesion** | Permanent bond | Often peels/fails |
| **Appearance** | Professional finish | Uneven, amateur look |
| **Warranty** | 5-10 years | None |
| **Cost** | $$$ | $ |
| **Cost per Year** | $ (best value) | $$ (fails quickly) |
| **Time to Install** | 1 day | 2-3 days |
| **Cure Time** | 1-4 hours | 24-48 hours |
| **Maintenance** | Easy | Moderate |
| **Success Rate** | 99%+ | 50-70% |

### **Why DIY Kits Fail:**

2. **Inferior materials** - Lower quality epoxy and flakes
3. **Application errors** - Uneven coating, improper mixing
4. **No warranty** - No recourse if it fails
5. **Peeling** - Adhesion failures are common
6. **Yellowing** - Epoxy yellows in sunlight
7. **Short lifespan** - 1-2 years vs 5-10 years
